            I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Engineering from Chandigarh University, skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS. Through projects and certifications like Web Development from Internshala and Software Testing from NPTEL, I have developed a strong foundation in frontend development. I am passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly web applications. My leadership as captain of my school&apos;s cricket team and active involvement in the NSS Programme have honed my teamwork and communication skills. I am eager to apply my technical expertise and enthusiasm for frontend development to contribute to innovative and impactful projects.
